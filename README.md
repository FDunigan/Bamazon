# Bamazon 
A customer interface allowing a user to shop through a database of products. The database is kept in MySQL, while JavaScript code (along with NPM inquirer) is used to ask users for the products they wish to purchase. Once a user selects an item and how many they wish to purchase, the app will either proceed to checkout (with the total price) or notify the user that their item is no longer in stock. In both cases, the user is then prompted to decide whether or not they would like to continue shopping.

`node bamazonCustomer.js`
- select a numeric product ID
- select a quantity to purchase
- enter yes or no to continue shopping

## Technologies Used
